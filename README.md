### 📝 Application Form

### 🎨 Animation-Showcase  
A dedicated project to demonstrate two types of hover animations:
- `ease-in` transform-based scaling
- left-to-right background color filling using `::before`

This project includes both animations, with the ability to **comment/uncomment CSS blocks** to toggle between effects and understand their behavior. It's ideal for animation learning and comparison.

## 🌈 Animations Used

### 🌀 Ease-In Animation:
Elements use `ease-in` timing to create a smooth, natural starting motion for transforms and background color changes.

```css
transition: all 0.4s ease-in;
transform: scale(1.05);
